# CO2-Analysis-with-PCA-and-KPCA-
Feature Extraction Methods for LA Ozone and CO2 Data

The EPA Ozone data and Vulcan CO2 Data are both large datasets and therefore are not available in github in their raw formats.

For the EPA Ozone data, the compressed file is available in "Raw/EPA_Air_Data/hourly_44201_2014.zip" In order to run the markdown file on a local clone of this project, unzip that file in its current folder. Alternatively, R Markdown code-chunk "load_epa_ozone" can be ignored and the user can start with the code chunk "load_limited_epa_ozone", which starts with the file "Intermediate/ozone_la_california.Rdata". This file was generated by the author and is just the EPA data limited to Los Angeles County.
